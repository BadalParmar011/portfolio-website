</ul><ul>

</ul><ul>
<li>[5]	NodeJS is required as mentioned before. Navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install the application as per your OS and requirements. Follow the steps, and set all conditions to default and install NodeJS in your system.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[6]	Check its version by running (node –v) in your terminal.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[7]	Similarly, check the version of npm Package Manager (npm –v).</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[8]	If you have old versions of any software, considering upgrading it / uninstalling and then installing the latest version.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[9]	Our client is going to be run from localhost: 3000 while the server is going to run from localhost: 5000 by default. If you maintain a basic knowledge about the system, you can go change it to your desired location.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[10] The Dependencies to be installed, for which all one need to do is run the commands mentioned earlier</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[11] Finally, navigate to the Resume_Builder Folder i.e. Resume_Builder_master in the terminal, then run the command – npm run dev</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[12] It will concurrently launch the client as well as the server at the locations mentioned above.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[13] Wait for a short period of time, if the file doesn’t begin executing, then open localhost: 3000 in your desired web browser.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>[14] In order to add/remove some parts of the resume as per your wish, fundamental understanding of ReactJS will be required. Each new page (part) of the Resume_Builder has been initialized separately as a separate component</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Location: Resume_Builder_master -&gt; client-&gt; src -&gt; components</li>
</ul><ul>
